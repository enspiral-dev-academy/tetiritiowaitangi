This is a placeholder site for some domain names we're parking for future resources about Te Tiriti o Waitangi.

The domain names that will redirect to this page are:

* tetiritiowaitangi.nz
* tetiritiowaitangi.org
* tetiritiowaitangi.co.nz
* tetiritiowaitangi.org.nz

Currently they all redirect to [https://tetiritiowaitangi.nz](https://tetiritiowaitangi.nz).

If you would like to manage some or all of these domain names for your work, please [get in touch](mailto:hello@devacademy.co.nz?subject=tetiritiowaitangi.nz) with us about your project and ideas and we'll consider transfering them to you or adjusting them for your needs.

We purchased these domain names because Te Tiriti o Waitangi, and being good treaty partners, is very important to [Enspiral Dev Academy](https://devacademy.co.nz). If you're reading this, we have not yet had the time to replace this text with an explanation of why we think it is important for all organisations in Aotearoa, New Zealand to be good treaty partners.
